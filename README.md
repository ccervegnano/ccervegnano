- 👋 Hi, I’m @ccervegnano
- 👀 I’m interested in Apple technology, but also . . . the opposite of that. Always seeking new experiences that are non-techmnology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how I can retire early.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bringing more personal, human touch to each interaction.
